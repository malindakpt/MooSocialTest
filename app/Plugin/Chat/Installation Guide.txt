	//--- install ---//

	*** Follow these steps to install "Chat" Plugin:

		1. Upload "app" folder and their contents to your site (allow overwrite old files) via FTP .

		2. Make sure Node.JS is installed on your server ( we recommend v6.9.1 or above ) then access your server via SSH, go to mooSite/app/Plugin/Chat/webroot/js/server directory
		   and  install module dependencies with npm : "npm install" .

               	3. After installing the dependencies , you can test the chat server by using the node command "node ."  .

               	4. In case it works , you need to kill the  application which is started in step 3  and we will focus on running it as a service  so that they will automatically restart on reboot or failure, and can safely be used in a production environment .
                   To do that , we recommend installing PM2 with npm command : "sudo npm install -g pm2" . After installing pm2 , you can start your chat server with pm2 command "pm2 start ChatApp.js" . Now your chat server is ready as http://yourdomain:3000 .
                   For more information , you can see : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-16-04

	//--- notice ---//

        If your server is using mooSocial 2.4.1 , you need to hack your template to use Google Material Icons for chat plugin by editing the file bellow  :
          1. mooSite/app/View/Layouts/default.ctp if you are using the default theme
          2. OR mooSite/app/View/Themed/your-template/Layouts/default.ctp if you don't use default theme
             and append link tags bellow in the header tag in the default page    :
             <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,300,500,700"/>
             <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"/>
             After that , your HTML heading tag like the example bellow :
             <head>
             ....
              <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,300,500,700"/>
              <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"/>
             </head>
          3. You need to replace the file MooPopupHelper.php in the patch_for_2_4_1 folder  to mooSite/app/View/Helper/MooPopupHelper.php if you want to replace Conversations  with Chat Messages
          4. Add events for Friend model by updating it in the file  mooSite/app/Model/Friend.php
          4.1 and find the line "public function afterSave($created, $options = array()){" then add the code "$this->getEventManager()->dispatch(new CakeEvent('Model.Friend.afterSave', $this));" bellow it
          4.2 and find the line "public function beforeDelete(){" then add the code "$this->getEventManager()->dispatch(new CakeEvent('Model.Friend.beforeDelete', $this));" bellow it

        You can skip the steps above if your mooSocial has a higher version than 2.4.1 .
